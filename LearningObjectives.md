### **1. Understand Linear Mixed-Effects Models**
- Differentiate between fixed effects (population-level) and random effects (subject-specific).
- Specify models with random intercepts and slopes to account for individual variability over time.
- Explore how interaction terms (e.g., time Ã— group) can reveal differing trajectories across groups.

---

### **2. Model Selection and Covariance Structures**
- Specify and compare covariance structures (e.g., compound symmetry, autoregressive, unstructured) to model correlation over time.
- Use AIC/BIC and likelihood ratio tests for model comparison and selection.
- Understand the implications of misspecified covariance structures on parameter estimates.

---

### **3. Handle Missing Data**
- Use maximum likelihood estimation or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to handle incomplete observations in linear mixed models.
- Assess whether missing data mechanisms (MCAR, MAR) are addressed appropriately in the model framework.

---

### **4. Conduct Exploratory Analysis**
- Generate visualizations such as spaghetti plots to understand variability within and between subjects.
- Perform descriptive statistics stratified by time and other key covariates.

---

### **5. Build and Interpret Linear Mixed Models**
- Fit linear mixed-effects models to analyze continuous outcomes over time.
- Interpret coefficients in terms of population means and individual deviations (e.g., fixed effect slopes represent average rate of change).
- Incorporate time-varying covariates to model their effect on the outcome.

---

### **6. Diagnostics and Model Validation**
- Check residuals for normality and homoscedasticity.
- Examine random effects for plausibility and variability.
- Validate models using cross-validation or by comparing predicted and observed trajectories.

---

### **7. Presentation of Results**
- Provide clear interpretations of fixed effects (e.g., average changes over time) and random effects (e.g., subject-level variability).
- Use confidence intervals and prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty.
- Visualize model-predicted trajectories alongside observed data for clear communication.
